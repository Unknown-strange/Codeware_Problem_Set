This repository contains my solutions to **Codewars challenges (Kata)**.  
It serves as a personal space to practice programming, improve problem-solving skills, and track growth over time.

Each file represents a kata I’ve completed.  
There is **no specific folder structure yet** — organization may evolve as the collection grows.

## ✅ Purpose
- Build problem-solving skills
- Practice clean, efficient code

This repo will be updated regularly as I complete more challenges and improve existing solutions.

Happy coding!
